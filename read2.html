    <p style="margin: 3rem 5rem 5rem 5rem; font-size:1.2rem">
      My village name is Hardoi Gujar and my District name is Jalaun.Which is 100 km from Jhansi
         in Uttar Pradesh.In my village, the name of 7000 people comes in the voting list.The name 
         of the sarpanch of my village is Raju Ahirwar.He is the sarpanch of our village for the 
         last two five years.There are two big playgrounds in our village but there is no sports 
         facility in them.There are 4 government schools in our village, but teachers never come to 
         those schools, because of this, there is no education in those schools.Medical facilities are 
         fine in our village.There is a water tank and a powerhouse in my village, so that we do not 
         have any problem related to water and electricity power.Caste religion and untouchability are 
         considered very much in the village.Caste religion and untouchability are considered very much 
         in the village, but in the midst of our new generation, all this is rarely seen.We help each 
         other in our village and all the people live in harmony with each other.Me and my friends helped 
         the people coming from other cities during the lockdown period and we also gave food to the 
         passers-by coming out of the village and arranged for them to rest by opening empty school rooms 
         and in between we also followed covid 19 protocol.
