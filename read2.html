    <h2 style="text-align: center; margin-top:1rem;"> THE STUDY OF “OMICRON” VARIANT</h2>
    <p style="margin: 3rem 5rem 5rem 5rem; font-size:1.2rem">
        Researchers in South Africa and around the world are conducting studies to better
        understand many aspects of Omicron and will continue to share the findings of
        these studies as they become available.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:  0rem 5rem 5rem 5rem; font-size:1.2rem">
        <strong>Transmissibility:</strong> It is not yet clear whether Omicron is more transmissible
        (e.g., more easily spread from person to person) compared to other variants, including Delta.
        The number of people testing positive has risen in areas of South Africa affected by this variant,
        but epidemiologic studies are underway to understand if it is because of Omicron or other factors.
        Severity of disease: It is not yet clear whether infection with Omicron causes more severe disease
        compared to infections with other variants, including Delta. Preliminary data suggests that there
        are increasing rates of hospitalization in South Africa, but this may be due to increasing overall
        numbers of people becoming infected, rather than a result of specific infection with Omicron.
        There is currently no information to suggest that symptoms associated with Omicron are different
        from those from other variants. Initial reported infections were among university students—younger
        individuals who tend to have more mild disease—but understanding the level of severity of the Omicron
        variant will take days to several weeks. All variants of COVID-19, including the Delta variant that is
        dominant worldwide, can cause severe disease or death, in particular for the most vulnerable people,
        and thus prevention is always key.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:  0rem 5rem 5rem 5rem; font-size:1.2rem">
        <strong>View on Omicron variant:</strong> Countries should not ban the flight from South Africa just because the
        variant has origin from there. This will destroy the Economy of the country and will create lots of
        problems for the citizens.
    </p>
    <p style="margin:  0rem 5rem 5rem 5rem; font-size:1.2rem">
        <strong> Update on Omicron in India :</strong> Two cases of Covid-19 Omicron variant were reported in Mumbai on
        Monday,
        taking India’s total tally of the new coronavirus variant to 23. The first two cases were reported in Karnataka,
        followed by one in Gujarat and another in Maharashtra. Later on Sunday, seven cases were reported in
        Maharashtra’s
        Pune district, of which six belonged to the same family.
        India recorded 6,822 new covid-19 cases and 200 deaths in the last 24 hours ending 8 am Tuesday.
        This is also the lowest single-day spike in over 18 months. Active cases stand at 95,014,
        the lowest in 554 days and over 10,000 people recovered on Monday.
